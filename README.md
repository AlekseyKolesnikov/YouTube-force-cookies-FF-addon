### FireFox extension to force some YouTube cookies.

Based on https://github.com/thisdotvoid/youtube-classic-extension

YouTube sometimes resets the country code after logging off. This is not convenient for me.

Use Ctrl+F5 after first loading YouTube when changing settings.
Country code means two-letter country code (US, GB, DE, ...).
